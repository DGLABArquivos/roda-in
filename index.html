<p>RODA-in is a tool specially designed for producers and archivists to create Submission Information Packages (SIP) ready to be submitted to an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). The tool creates SIPs from files and folders available on the local file system. </p>

<p>In version 2 we revolutionized the way SIPs are created to satisfy the need for mass processing of data. In this version you can create thousands of valid SIPs with just a few clicks, complete with data and metadata.</p>

<p>The tool includes features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create, load and edit classification schemas</li>
<li>Automatic association of files/folders to SIP</li>
<li>Automatic association of metadata to SIP</li>
<li>Definition of metadata templates</li>
<li>Support for various metadata formats (EAD, DC, etc.)</li>
<li>Creation of SIP of unlimited size</li>
<li>Creation of SIP in various formats: <a href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-java">BagIt</a> and <a href="http://www.eark-project.com/resources/project-deliverables/51-d33pilotspec">E-ARK</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This application was part of the <a href="http://www.roda-community.org">RODA project</a> and now has been released as a project by its own due to the increasing interest in its particular functionality. It is now being further developed in the <a href="http://www.eark-project.com">E-ARK project</a> to support the E-ARK SIP format.</p>

<h2>
<a id="supported-sip-formats" class="anchor" href="#supported-sip-formats" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supported SIP formats</h2>

<p>RODA-in supports several Submission Information Package formats. At the moment we have included support for:</p>

<ul>
<li>BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format for storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" has just enough structure to enclose descriptive "tags" and a "payload" but does not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics. This BagIt format should be suitable for disk-based or network-based storage and transfer.  BagIt is widely used in the practice of digital preservation. The specification of BagIt can be found <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-13">here</a>.</li>
<li>E-ARK SIP format, a Submission Information Package format developed by the EU funded E-ARK Project. The specification can be found <a href="http://www.eark-project.com/resources/project-deliverables/17-d32-e-ark-sip-draft-specification/file">here</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>RODA-in has been successfully tested on:</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Windows 7, 8 and 10.</li>
<li>[x] Mac OS X El Capitan</li>
<li>[x] Ubuntu Desktop 14</li>
</ul>

<p>To use RODA-In you must have Java 8 installed in your operating system. Go ahead, download Java and install it in your system before downloading RODA-in.</p>

<p>Java 8 can be downloaded <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="download-pre-compiled-version" class="anchor" href="#download-pre-compiled-version" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download pre-compiled version</h2>

<p>The latest version of RODA-in is available <a href="https://github.com/keeps/roda-in/releases">here</a>.</p>

<p>To use RODA-in no installation is required. You just need to download the latest release of the application and run it by double clicking the downloaded file (*.jar extension). If that doesn't work, open a console window (or terminal) and type</p>

<pre><code>java -jar roda-in-app-x.y.z.jar
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use</h2>

<p>The basic workflow of the application is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose a working folder in your file system (panel on the left). This will serve as the root of your project.</li>
<li>Choose or create a classification scheme (panel on the center). There's two options:

<ul>
<li>Load a classification scheme. You can obtain a classification scheme from RODA repository, for example.</li>
<li>Create a new classification scheme. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drag files/folders from the left panel to the center panel into the appropriate node in the classification scheme.</li>
<li>Choose the type of data and metadata association. This will have impact on the number and structure of the SIPs created.</li>
<li>(Optional) Inspect the created SIPs, edit metadata and content.</li>
<li>Export the SIPs to a folder</li>
</ol>

<p>To select more than one file/folder you can press SHIFT or CTRL.</p>

<p>The following actions are supported to edit the classification scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add node</li>
<li>Edit the title and the description level of the node</li>
<li>Move node (using drag and drop)

<ul>
<li>Change parent</li>
<li>Move to the root of the tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove node</li>
</ul>

<p>Metadata templates exist under the folder "roda-in" in your home directory ("Documents" for Windows users). Open the files with your favourite text editor and make sure they remain valid XML files acording to the provided schemas.</p>

<h3>
<a id="got-error-javalangoutofmemoryerror-java-heap-space-what-do-i-do" class="anchor" href="#got-error-javalangoutofmemoryerror-java-heap-space-what-do-i-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Got error "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space". What do I do?</h3>

<p>The application might need more memory than what is available by default (normally 64MB). To increase the available memory use the -Xmx option. For example, the following command will increase the heap size to 3 GB.</p>

<pre><code>$ java -Xmx3g -jar roda-in-app-x.y.z.jar
</code></pre>

<p>The application needs enough memory to put the file structure definition in memory (not the data).</p>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
